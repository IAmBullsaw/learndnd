# learndnd

I've always wanted a simple online dnd guide which takes me on a small solo adventure to learn the basics of dnd rules.
Nothing fancy, no bells and whistles. Simple things, clear rules, hard rail roading.

## Plan
- [ ] Write a simple mission, starting in a tavern of course
- [ ] Plan out how to write the app
- [ ] Write the app
- [ ] Launch it online so people can explain the rules to me
